Build me a personal portfolio website with the following structure and style:

1. Hero / Landing Section  
   - Show my name prominently.  
   - A short tagline or one-line about what I do (e.g. “Full-Stack Web Developer” or “Digital Creator & Developer”).  
   - A professional but friendly vibe — clean layout, minimalistic, modern typography & spacing.

2. About / Bio Section  
   - A short paragraph (or two) describing who I am, what I’m passionate about, my background and what I do.  
   - Optionally: a small profile photo or avatar (if I choose to include one).  
   - Clean design, easily readable, good spacing.

3. Skills / Services Section  
   - List of relevant skills or services I offer (e.g. front-end dev, back-end, full-stack, design, etc.).  
   - Organized visually — maybe badges or simple list — but clear and minimalistic.

4. Projects / Work Section  
   - Showcase 3–6 (or more) of my best works or projects.  
   - For each project: a title, a short description, and if possible a link or image/screenshot.  
   - Layout should be grid or card-based, simple and clean, consistent styling.

5. Contact / Reach-Out Section  
   - Provide clear contact options: email, social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) depending on what I have.  
   - Maybe also a call-to-action (e.g. “Let’s work together”, “Contact me”, etc.).  

6. Optional Extras (if relevant)  
   - Blog or writing — if I want to share articles or posts.  
   - Downloadable résumé / CV link or button.  
   - Testimonials or highlights (if I have past clients or feedback).  
   - A simple custom logo or personal branding element (font, colors) to make site feel unique to me.  

Design / Style Guidelines:  
- Minimal, modern, and clean layout.  
- Easy navigation — smooth scroll / simple menu.  
- Responsive design (works well on mobile & desktop).  
- Readable fonts, enough whitespace, good use of sections to separate content.  
- Focus on clarity: show value, not clutter.
